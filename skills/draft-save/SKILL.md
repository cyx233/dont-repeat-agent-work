# Draft Save

Save this session's work as a controllable, reusable script.

## Source

- `--commit <ref>`: read `git diff $COMMIT~1..$COMMIT`
- Otherwise: review what was done in this conversation

## Before writing

1. List existing scripts in the target directory
2. If a script with the same name OR overlapping purpose already exists:
   - Show the user a diff of old vs new
   - Default to updating in-place (Edit) rather than overwriting (Write)
   - If the scope changed significantly, ask whether to update or create a separate script
3. If no overlap found, proceed with new file creation

## What to extract

- Side effects only (file edits, writes, installs, deploys)
- Final state only (collapse retries)
- Verification step at the end if one existed
- Hardcoded values → `@param`

## Output

Pick the language that fits the task. Frontmatter format:

```
# @draft
# @name <name>
# @description <one line>
# @param <name> <type> "<description>" [default]
# @triggers <comma-separated phrases that should match this script>
```

- `@triggers`: natural-language phrases the user might type when they want this task done. Used by draft-match to surface the script. Include the obvious verbs and short aliases.

## Target directory

- `--global` → `~/.claude/scripts/` (shared across all projects)
- default → `.claude/scripts/` (project-local)

Write to `<target>/<name>.<ext>`, `chmod +x`.
Show the script, ask if user wants to edit.
